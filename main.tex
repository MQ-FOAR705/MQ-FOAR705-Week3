\section{Minute card reflection}
\begin{frame}{Assignment overview 1}

One major theme of feedback (from sticky notes, slack, and the jargon document) is that we need to discuss all of the assignments and how they fit together.

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item Proof of Concept (Technology Demonstration)
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
% \item Scoping (Due sunday, because we misconfigured dates)
% \item Elaboration Plan: Finding tools and techniques that can help solve your problem. Due before class Week 4.
% \item Elaboration Results: Testing the claims of these tools and techniques. Do they do what they say they're going to do? Due before class week 6.
% \item Deployment: Design your proof of concept of your solution to the problem defined during your scoping? How will the tools and techniques you've found actually combine together to solve your problem? What do you need to do? (Week 9) -- Now, do it (week 11). 
% \item Testing and polishing. Make sure that there exists enough documentation and testing around your combination of tools and techniques such that other people might be able to use them somewhat reliably, \textit{or} document the known failings of your combination and articulate how, if given more time, you would proceed to fix them. (Week 13)
\item Scoping (due sunday)
\item Elaboration plan (due before class, week 4)
\item Elaboration results (due before class week 6)
\item Proof of Concept Design or starting `deployment' (Due before class week 7)
\item Proof of concept component demonstration (Due before class week 9)
\item Proof of concept linking demonstration (due before class week 11)
\item Final version (Due before class week 13)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assignment overview 2}
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]

\item Learning Journal (Covered last week. Any technical work you do in this class should go into its own section). No formatting rules, though we disrecommend using word because it breaks things. (Due 4 times throughout semester)
\item Lighting Talks (PICO Presentations) (Presenting your Proof of Concept (Tech Demo)) in a 2 minute mixed presentation/poster format. See EGU Pico presentation. (During exam time)
\item Original Software Publication (Presenting your proof of concept as a paper which could be published in the SoftwareX Journal) (Due Week 13)
\end{itemize}

% Shawn, what visible thing will we change in reaction?
\end{frame}

\section{Jargon Busting}
\begin{frame}{To open with, some jargon busting}
Via @sheri: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/f/3774955770

Some terms of note:

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item Proof of Concept (POC): `Assignment for FOAR705. See "Scoping", "Elaboration", "Deployment" A mechanism for describing, then creating a technology (tool and/or technique) workflow to assist your research.' The major work you will be doing over this semester. 
    \item Typesetting: `Typesetting is the careful arrangement of text in a typeface in order to achieve maximum legibility,' \cite{Newcomb2019-hm}. The fourth step in the composition process (Preceded by Outlining (figuring out exactly what you want to say, and in what order, down to sub-paragraph detail), Writing, and Editing).
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\section{Data Carpentry}
\begin{frame}{Discussion from last week}

Discussion:

\begin{itemize}
\item Episode 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item What was wrong with the SAFI `messy' data?
\item What metadata should be recorded for the `clean' data?
\end{itemize}
\item Episode 2:
\begin{itemize}
\item What dirty data sets did you find?
\item What errors did you find counterintuitive?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Dates as Data}

\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/excel_dates_1.jpg}
        \caption{Actual value in cells: `41822', `41834', and `1'. Dates as data, Data Carpentry. CC-By}
        \label{fig:bigdates}
    \end{figure}

Also beware: Regional Date formatting.


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Exercise}

Download and open the dates.xlsx file. This file contains a subset of the data from the SAFI interviews, including the dates on which the interviews were conducted.

Choose the tab of the spreadsheet that corresponds to the way you format dates in your location (either day first {\tt DD\_MM\_YEAR }, or month first {\tt MM\_DD\_YEAR} ).

Extract the components of the date to new columns. For this we can use the built in Excel functions:

{\tt =MONTH()} 

{\tt =DAY()}

{\tt =YEAR()}

Apply each of these formulas to its entire column. Make sure the new column is formatted as a number and not as a date.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exercise}
Using the same spreadsheet you used for the previous exercise, add another data point in the {\tt interview\_date} column by typing either {\tt 11/17} (if your location uses {\tt MM/DD} formatting) or {\tt 17/11} (if your location uses {\tt DD/MM} formatting). The {\tt Day}, {\tt Month}, and {\tt Year} columns should populate for this new data point. What year is shown in the {\tt Year} column?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Notes on Quality Assurance}

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item Do one thing at a time.
    \item Constrain inputs as much as you can.
    \item Calculations should have validation/sanity checks.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Computational Thinking}

\begin{frame}{What is Computational Thinking?}

Computers are good at some things. Mostly boring and repetitive things. 

People are good at other things. Mostly creative and interesting things.

Computers are fast but stupid. They need clear, step-by-step instructions (which they can then execute quickly).

Computational thinking is an approach that lets you decide \textbf{what} computers are good for, and \textbf{how} to tell the computer to do what you want.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Decomposition and algorithm design}

\textbf{Computational Thinking }(CT) is a problem solving process that includes a number of characteristics and dispositions. \cite{Google2019-es}
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
    \item \textbf{Decomposition}: Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, manageable parts.
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Design}: Developing the step by step instructions for solving this and similar problems.
\end{itemize}

Bonus points for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition}: Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data.
    \item \textbf{Abstraction}: Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% \end{itemize}    

% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Learning Journal pattern}

% All technical work outside of class, and all Carpentry exercises should be recorded in a document in cloudstor.

% For each discrete action taken. (Exercise, part of exercise, command run, code changed, code added, etc...)
% \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
%     \item The intention of the action: ``What do you intend to be the result of the action you are about to take''
%     \item The specifics of the action taken: Timestamp, commands or actions
%     \item Results: note success or failure, screenshot or copy-paste or summary, error states
%     \item Marginal notes for improvements on what to do or how to think about the idea more effectively
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{Documentation of errors is critical for success}
% % , , and the results, along with any marginal notes for improvement or updating your mental model of what should have had happened
% % All technical work outside of class should be recorded in a laboratory notebook (document kept with the code or on cloudstor) which documents the intention of the action, the specifics of the action taken, and the results, along with any marginal notes for improvement or updating your mental model of what should have had happened. This documentation includes: an answer to the specific objective: "What do you intend to be the result of the action you are about to take", the action to be taken containing timestamp, and commands or actions performed, and the result, documenting what happened, success or failure in relation to the objective, and error states. Documentation of errors (each in its own entry) and their remediation are strongly encouraged.

% \begin{frame}{What is an HD?}
% \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]

% \item Errors are documented along with steps to recover, just like any other action in the lab notebook. 
% \item All entries have an objective articulated before they are run. 
% \item Commands and code are clearly indicated for future reference. 
% \item Results are clearly documented, and contain a minimal amount of self-reflective feedback to inform the next attempt.
% \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Committing code and exercises}

% For Carpentries exercises or other experiments (code not directly related to your proof of concept), make a repository (public or private) inside the MQ-FOAR705 organisation on Github. Commit code or outputs (reorganised sheets, etc) to that repository.

% An HD:
% \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
% \item Commit messages are clear and have useful descriptions, not just summary lines. 
% \item Files and directories are organised consistently in a fashion which allows for easy command line navigation and sorting (no spaces or other problematic characters). 
% \item All work, not just technical, is committed to an appropriate repository. 
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}{Exercise}

% We’re going to take a messy version of the SAFI data and describe how we would clean it up.

% \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]

% \item Download the messy data.
% \item Open up the data in a spreadsheet program.
% \item Notice that there are two tabs. Two researchers conducted the interviews, one in Mozambique and the other in Tanzania. They both structured their data tables in a different way. Now, you’re the person in charge of this project and you want to be able to start analyzing the data.
% \item With the person next to you, identify what is wrong with this spreadsheet. Discuss the steps you would need to take to clean up the two tabs, and to put them all together in one spreadsheet.
% \item Document your group's thoughts in the cloudstor shared document.
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{Important} Do not forget our first piece of advice, to create a new file (or tab) for the cleaned data, never modify your original (raw) data.

% After you go through this exercise, we’ll discuss as a group what was wrong with this data and how you would fix it.

% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Metadata}

% ``Data about data''

% Exercise (maybe):

% Download a clean version of this dataset and open the file with your spreadsheet program. This data has many more variables that were not included in the messy spreadsheet and is formatted according to tidy data principles.

% Discuss this data with a partner and make a list of some of the types of metadata that should be recorded about this dataset. It may be helpful to start by asking yourself, “What is not immediately obvious to me about this data? What questions would I need to know the answers to in order to analyze and interpret this data?”

% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Homework}

% Before class next week, in your learning journal, finish reading to ``Formatting Problems'' and document the two exercises we've (hopefully) done today in your Github repository. Also in your learning journal, find an example of each problem in data produced by your discipline. (Bonus points if you can find these problems in published datasets in your discipline).

% \section{Research design 101}

% \begin{frame}{Articulating research design}
% Robust research requires articulation of an explicit research design 
%     \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
%         \item Deductive vs. Inductive vs. Abductive
%         \item Idiographic vs. Nomothetic 
%     \end{itemize}   
% Each type is valuable, but you must recognise what you are doing and not conflate them.
% \end{frame}

% \section{Proof of Concept scoping 101}

% \begin{frame}{What is scoping?}
% To ensure that a product actually solves user problems, software development begins with `Business Analysis' (BA), where user requirements are enumerated. 

% But how do we gather requirements and act on them to produce a solution?

% It is surprisingly difficult to learn what clients (even yourself!) really need and want
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Approach \#1: Ask what people want (opinions)}

%         \item Identify 'gains' (see 'Customer Gains trigger questions')
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Ideate a solution}
%     After you have completed the 'Customer Profile' worksheet, look at the 'Value Map' worksheet
%     \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
%         \item Identify 'pain relievers' that map to pains (see 'Pain Relievers trigger questions')
%         \item Identify 'gains creators' that map to gains (see 'Gain Creator trigger questions')

% %     `Data Carpentry trains researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices. We run accessible, inclusive training workshops; teach openly available, high-quality, domain-tailored lessons; and foster an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm.' \cite{Teal2016-gy}

% %     `Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Our volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events for more than 34,000 researchers since 2012.' \cite{Duckles2018-fu}
